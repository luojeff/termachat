PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
A chatroom program through intranet that runs purely in the terminal. Allows clients on different computers to connect to
a chatroom and communicate by messaging. Clients have the ability to create chatrooms, either public or private,
and invite friends to join.

User interface & other details:
- Will be all run in the terminal
- When a client runs (assuming the server has been started), the program will prompt for a display name
- Client starts off in a global chatroom
- Messages sent by the client and other clients are shown in the terminal, all prefixed by their display name
- To send a message, the client can type in the "prompt" (like in a bash shell) and hit ENTER
- To create a smaller chatroom, the client can type in a "command" (prefixed with a '#' in the prompt)
- Clients and other members can join individual chatrooms using commands (perhaps '#join <chatroom id>')
- Clients can also send private messages and delete chatrooms using a similar command syntax
- When joining an existing chatroom, each client should see the existing conversation


TECHNICAL DESIGN:
Key topics & concepts:
- Networking for connecting clients on different machines on the same network
- Using file information when sending files, such as size
- Subprocesses; main server breaks into sub-servers, each acting as individual chatrooms
- Signals to handle client inputs. When exiting, notifications should be sent to the chatroom
- Semaphores to handle multiple client requests to server
- Pipes to send information between servers and clients

Data structures:
- Queues??

Algorithms:
-

TIMELINE:
by ??/??/??: Setup basic server and client connection. (Handshake, pipes)
by ??/??/??: Extend to include subservers that handle multiple clients (not through intranet)
by ??/??/??: Setup networking to allow clients to connect to chatroom servers running on other machines
by ??/??/??: Setup semaphores to handle multiple clients in a chatroom
by ??/??/??: Setup command handling (chatroom creation/deletion, private messaging)
by ??/??/??: Setup basic file transfer by writing bytes (change client-side to handle this)
